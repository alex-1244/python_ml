This movie is wrong on many levels. You cannot get into it, it just feels like a documentary with kids voice on top of it. Most important scenes have been shortened, and useless scenes (cheaper ones my guess) have been lengthen (the mouse in the intro ? seriously ?). Yes, the goal is to put realism, but we could not tell the difference between lions (Sarabi and Nala in paritcular). Everything the original Lion King brought to us (essentially emotions, mostly from the animated faces) has been ripped off, event the few jokes by Timon and Pumbaa did not succeed to pass. Last but not least, the music seems off too. Some good scores are here, but at the end it just seems to be put above everything like "eyh we need to put music" "ok just put it anywhere you want, dont forget suggestions to the previous score for nostalgia but dont care about if it fits". This movie is an insult to an entire generation.
